# ProThemesRU Deployment Fix

## Issue Identified
The deployment is failing because of a PostgreSQL dependency (`psycopg2-binary`) that's not needed for Vercel deployment. The app uses SQLite by default, which is perfect for Vercel.

## What I Fixed
✅ **Updated `requirements.txt`** - Removed the problematic `psycopg2-binary` dependency
✅ **Kept only essential dependencies** - Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-JWT-Extended, Flask-CORS, Werkzeug, python-dotenv, requests

## Current requirements.txt (Fixed)
```
Flask==2.3.3
Flask-SQLAlchemy==3.0.5
Flask-JWT-Extended==4.5.3
Flask-CORS==4.0.0
Werkzeug==2.3.7
python-dotenv==1.0.0
requests==2.31.0
```

## Manual Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit the Fixed Requirements
```bash
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Fix deployment: remove psycopg2-binary dependency"
git push origin master
```

### 2. Verify Deployment
After pushing, Vercel will automatically redeploy. The build should now succeed because:
- ✅ No PostgreSQL dependencies
- ✅ Uses SQLite (perfect for Vercel)
- ✅ All essential Flask dependencies included
- ✅ App is properly configured for Vercel

### 3. Test the API
Once deployed, test these endpoints:
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/` - Home page
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health` - Health check
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/templates` - Templates list

## Why This Fix Works

1. **SQLite Database**: The app uses SQLite by default (`sqlite:///prothemesru.db`), which is perfect for Vercel's serverless environment
2. **No External Dependencies**: Removed PostgreSQL which requires system-level dependencies
3. **Minimal Requirements**: Only includes what's actually used in the app
4. **Vercel Compatible**: All remaining dependencies work perfectly with Vercel's Python runtime

## Expected Result
After this fix, your deployment should:
- ✅ Build successfully
- ✅ Deploy without errors
- ✅ Have a working API
- ✅ Include all features (auth, templates, sites, payments)

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push the changes
2. Wait for Vercel to redeploy (usually 2-3 minutes)
3. Test the API endpoints
4. Deploy your Telegram bot separately on Railway

The app is now optimized for Vercel deployment and should work perfectly!
